## âœ… Task 2: Basic Java Programming

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2.1 â€“ User Information System
- **What I learned**: Practiced encapsulation using getters and setters; used constructors to initialize objects.
- **Challenges**: Managing multiple object instances.
- **Testing**: Created 3 user objects in the `main()` method and verified field access using getters/setters.
- **Improvement**: Could implement Scanner to take input from the user.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2.2 â€“ Employee Payroll System
- **What I learned**: Applied conditional logic with `switch` and `if-else`; worked with arrays and methods.
- **Challenges**: Creating appropriate switch cases to handle invalid types along with tax deduction logic.
- **Testing**: Utilized test data to simulate different employee types and pay scenarios.
- **Improvement**: Use object-oriented design for employee types to reduce repetitive conditionals.

## âœ… Task 3: Arrays and Strings

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3.1 â€“ Student Grade Manager
- **What I learned**: Gained confidence manipulating arrays and strings; handled scoring logic.
- **Challenges**: Needing to learn reverse string logic as it was a new concept and implementing it.
- **Testing**: Checked letter grades, reversed names, and identified failing students through the console.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3.2 â€“ Text Processor
- **What I learned**: Explored string methods, including `replace()` and `split()`.
- **Challenges**: Hadn't worked with text replacement or split methods before so had to learn that and handle exceptions.
- **Testing**: Used test strings given in the template.
- **Improvement**: Accept user input via console.

## âœ… Task 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### ðŸ”¹ Task 4.1 â€“ Library Book System
- **What I learned**: Practiced inheritance, `super()`, and encapsulation.
- **Challenges**: Using `super()` to call parent constructor and using inheritance classes that could not be defined as public within the same Book class.
- **Testing**: Created sample books and textbooks; verified method outputs via console.
- **Improvement**: Implement an interactive menu system for borrowing and returning books.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 4.2 â€“ Static vs Non-Static Practice
- **What I learned**: The difference between class-level (static) and instance-level variables and methods.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring correct static updates across multiple instances.
- **Testing**: Created 3 visitors and tracked visits and totals in the console.

## âœ… Task 5: Problem Solving

### ðŸ”¹ Task 5.1 â€“ ShoppingCart Logic
- **What I learned**: Writing clean loops and conditions for business logic.
- **Challenges**: Using switch case statements for identifying customer type and applying loop logic to find highest price.
- **Testing**: Manually validated outputs for different customer types.
- **Improvement**: Add error handling for edge cases like empty cart.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 5.2 â€“ PatternMaker
- **What I learned**: Practiced nested loops and string formatting.
- **Challenges**: New concept so getting the alignment of the triangle pattern was challenging.
- **Testing**: Printed various patterns to check output matching.
- **Improvement**: Make pattern generation more customizable.
