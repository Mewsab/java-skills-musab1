## 🚀 About the Assessment

This assessment simulates a real-world development environment to evaluate my ability to:

- Write Java code that is clean, readable, and efficient
- Solve algorithmic and logical problems using control structures
- Apply object-oriented principles like inheritance and encapsulation
- Handle different employee and business scenarios
- Use Git effectively for version control and branch management

## 🧩 Tasks Breakdown

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Task 2** | Basic Java: UserInfo class, Payroll System |
| **Task 3** | Arrays & Strings: Grade Manager, Text Processor |
| **Task 4** | OOP: Library System, Static vs Non-Static Counter |
| **Task 5** | Problem Solving: ShoppingCart logic, Pattern printing |

Each task is arranged in its corresponding git branch.
